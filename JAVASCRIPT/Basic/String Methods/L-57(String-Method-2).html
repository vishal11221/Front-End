    <p>charAt method is used to find the value from index no.If value is not their at given position then nothing it return.</p>
    <p>charCodeAt method is used to find the ASCII value from index no from existing string.</p>
    <p>fromCharCode method is used to find the ASCII value from index no directly not from existing string and all.</p>
    <p>concat method is used to merge two or more than two string.</p>
    <p>split method is used to break the existing string and return new array.</p>
    <p>repeat method is used to repeat the existing string.In this method we pass parameter as no that means how many times we repeat our existing string.</p>
    <p>slice method is used to get the value from that index to that index.In that we send two parameter from starting to end.</p>
    <p>substr method is used to get the value from that index to that index.In that we send two parameter from starting to end.</p>
    <p>subString method is used to get the value from that index to that index.In that we send two parameter from starting to end.</p>

    <script>
        var str = 'javascript is great language now a days';
        var chAt = str.charAt(5);
        console.log(chAt);//it return c because c find at fifth index.

        var str2 = 'Php is a backend language';
        var chrcdAt = str2.charCodeAt(2);
        console.log(chrcdAt);//it return 112 because at 2nd index small p has 112 ASCII value.

        var a = String.fromCharCode(65);
        console.log(a);//it return capital A because at 65 ASCII value is A.

        var frontEnd = 'Angular';
        var backend =  'Nodejs';
        var fullstack = frontEnd.concat(backend);
        console.log(fullstack);

        var str3 = 'Angular is a javascript framework';
        var splt = str3.split('a');
        console.log(splt);

        var str4 = 'Bootstrap is a css framework';
        var rpt = str4.repeat(2);
        console.log(rpt);

        var str5 = 'Reactjs is a javascript library';
        var slc = str5.slice(2,10);
        console.log(slc);//it return the value between 2nd index to 10th index.

        var int = 50;
        var result = int.toString();
        console.log(result + 70);//it return 5070 because toString method convert 50 into as a string then concatinate with 70.
