    <p>For loop is also a type of loop that we use to execute one statement at more than one time.For loop is totally different from other loop due to it's syntax,it initilization,condition and increment in only one line,so developer mostly use that one.</p>

        //Write a program to print the value from 1 to 10 using For loop.
        for (let index = 0; index<= 10; index++) {
             document.write(index + "<br>")
            
        }
