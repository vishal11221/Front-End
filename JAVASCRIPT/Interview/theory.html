    <title>Javascript Topices for Interview</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ol>
        <li>Tell me about yourself:- My name is vishal raj. I am from Motihari,Bihar. I complete my Engineering from Graphic era university,dehradun.
        Currently i am working as Software Engineer in REConnect Energy Solution that is located at Bengaluru,karnataka.
        My role and responsibility to develop web pages based on project requirement using technology, HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP,JAVASCRIPT and Angular and working close with my team using Git for verson control and jira for task and project management.</li>

        <li>Javascript is a Client Side Scripting Language. It is used to create dynamic and interactive web pages.Basically JavaScript use to add dynamic behavior to web pages, like click events, form validation, and dynamic content updates.</li>
        <li>Javascript is cross-platform language. It can be used in any platform.</li>

        <li>Datatype in Javascript:- String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined</li>

        <li>Difference between Null and Undefined:- Null is a value, Undefined is a variable. For example:- When we declare a variable but not assign any value to it then it is undefined. When we assign null to it then it is null.</li>

        <li>var,let,const are special keywords used to declare variables — they are not variables themselves.</li>

        <li>Difference between var, let and const:- var can be updated and re-declared , Is function-scoped, not block-scoped. let can be updated but not re-declared , Is block-scoped. const cannot be updated or re-declared , Is block-scoped.</li>

        <li>Difference between Function Scope and Block Scope ? 
            Function declare with their function name and the variable inside a function declare it scope or access within a function not outside of function that declare with var keyword. Block have no name, it declare with curly braces and the variable inside a block declare it scope or access within a block not outside of block that declare with let or const keyword.
        </li>

        <li>Local & Global Scope:- Local scope is a variable that is declared inside a function or within a block that have some boundaries. Global scope is a variable that is declared outside a function or outside a block that have no boundaries, user can access it anywhere.</li>

        <li>Difference between == and === :- == checks only value. === checks value and datatype. for example:- var x = 5; var y = "5"; console.log(x == y); console.log(x === y);</li>

        <li>What is "this" operator in Javascript:- This operator is used to access the current object. for example:- var obj = {fname: "John",lname: "Doe" ,age: 30 , fullname: function() { return this.fname + " " + this.lname;}}; console.log(obj.fullname());</li>

        <li>What is ternary operator in Javascript:- Ternary operator is used to check a condition like if else. for example:- var x = 5; var y = 10; var result = x > 10 ? "Greater" : "Lesser";</li>

        <li>What is closure in Javascript:- Closures are created when a function returns a function.Closures allow inner functions to access variables from their outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.for example:-

            function outerFunction() {
                var x = 5;
                y = 10; // Still global (intentionally left as-is to match original)
            
                function innerFunction() {
                return x + y;
                }
            
                // Return the inner function
                return innerFunction;
            }
            
            var result = outerFunction(); // Call outer and store the inner function
            console.log(result()); // Output: 15
        </li>

        <li>What is callback in JavaScript:- Callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. 
         // Example of a callback function
            function greet(name) {
                console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            }
            
            function sayHello(callback, name) {
                callback(name);
            }
            
            sayHello(greet, "John");
            // Output: Hello, John!
        </li>

        <li>What is hoisting in Javascript:- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. for example:- 
            <ul>
                <li>console.log(a); // Output: undefined</li>
                <li>var a = 5;</li>
                <li>var b; console.log(b); // Output: undefined </li>
                <li>b = 10;</li>
                <li>sayHello(); function sayHello() { console.log("Hello!"); }</li>
           </ul> 
        </li>

        <li>What is prototype in Javascript:- Prototype is a JavaScript object that is used to add properties and methods to other objects.
            Ex:- function Person(name, age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
              }
              
              Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
                console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
              };
              
              var person1 = new Person("John", 30);
              person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
        </li>
         <li>What is Promise in JavaScript:- Promise is a JavaScript object that allows you to handle the success and failure of an asynchronous operation.
            Ex:- // Create a new promise
            let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              let success = true;
            
              if (success) {
                resolve("The operation was successful!");
              } else {
                reject("The operation failed.");
              }
            });
            
            // Use the promise
            myPromise
              .then((message) => {
                console.log("Success:", message);
              })
              .catch((error) => {
                console.log("Error:", error);
              });
        </li>

        <li>What is setTimeout and setInterval in JavaScript:- setTimeout() is a JavaScript function that executes a specified function once after a given delay (in milliseconds). setInterval() is a JavaScript function that repeatedly executes a specified function at fixed time intervals (in milliseconds) until it is stopped using clearInterval().
            Ex:- console.log("Start");
            setTimeout(function() {
              console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
            }, 2000);
            
            console.log("End");
            
            Example of setInterval:-
            let count = 0;
            const intervalId = setInterval(function() {
              count++;
              console.log("Count:", count);
            
              // Stop the interval after it reaches 5
              if (count === 5) {
                clearInterval(intervalId);
                console.log("Interval stopped");
              }
            }, 1000);</li>

        <li>What is the difference between document.getElementById() and querySelector():-</li>

        <li>Difference between asynchronous and synchronous:- In synchronous execution, tasks are completed one at a time in a single sequence. The code runs from top to bottom, with each line waiting for the previous one to complete before moving on. Each task blocks the next one until it finishes. In asynchronous execution, tasks are executed concurrently, allowing multiple tasks to run in parallel.
            // Example of synchronous execution
            console.log("Task 1");
            console.log("Task 2");
            console.log("Task 3");
            
            // Example of asynchronous execution
            console.log("Task 1");
            setTimeout(() => {
              console.log("Task 2");
            }, 1000);
            console.log("Task 3");
            // Output: Task 1, Task 3, Task 2
            //Note:- In asynchronous code,some tasks like setTimeout,API calls,promises are delayed and other code continues running without waiting for them.   
        </li>

         <li>Difference between async and await ?
            async and await both are keywords in JavaScript used to handle asynchronous operations. The main difference is that async declare a function as asynchronous and it always returns a Promise, while await is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.
        </li>

        <li>What is IIFE in JavaScript:- IIFE is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression, which is a self-executing function.It is a function that runs immediately after it's defined — without being called separately.
        // Example of an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
            (function() {
              var name = "Vishalraj";
              console.log("Hello " + name);
            })();

            
            // function expression
            var result = (function() {
                return "This code is executed immediately";
            })();
            console.log(result);</li>

        <li>What is arrow function ? How it differ from regular function:- Arrow function is a function that is defined using the => operator. It is a shorter way to write a function. for example:- var add = (a, b) => a + b; var multiply = (a, b) => a * b; console.log(add(2, 3)); console.log(multiply(2, 3));</li>
        <li>Note:- If we have single parameter and single statement then no need of round and curly braces, we can write it like this:- var add = a => a + 5; console.log(add(2)); in a single line.</li>

        <li>Difference between Rest parameter and Spread operator:- Rest operator is used to collect multiple arguments into a single array. Spread operator is used to expand an array into individual elements.
            Ex:- function sum(...args) {
              let total = 0;
              for (let arg of args) {
                total += arg;
              }
              return total;
            }
            console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

            Example of Spread operator:- 
            const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
            const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
            const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
            console.log(arr3);
        </li>

        <li>Difference between function declaration and function expression:- Function declaration is used to declare a function before it is called. Function expression is used to declare a function after it is called.
            // Function declaration
            function add(a, b) {
              return a + b;
            }
            
            // Function expression
            var add = function(a, b) {
              return a + b;
            };
        </li>
        <li>What is Template Literals in JavaScript:- Template literals are strings that allow you to embed expressions inside them.It embed expression and string using backticks(`).
            Ex:- var name = "John";
            var age = 30;
            var message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
        </li>
        <li>Difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage:- localStorage is for long-term storage across sessions,
            while sessionStorage is for temporary storage in a single tab.In localStorage data are stored even after the browser is closed. But in sessionStorage data are deleted when the browser is closed.
        </li>
        <li>Difference between Ajax and Fetch:- Ajax is a technique to send/receive data from a server in the background using JavaScript, without refreshing the entire page while Fetch is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.Ajax requires jquery(external library) while fetch built into modern browser(no need external library)</li>

        <li>What is console.trace() in JavaScript:- console.trace() allow developers to see the sequence of function calls in the console. It is useful for debugging and tracing code execution.</li>
